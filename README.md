# machine_learning

This is my ML library.

Already done work:

1. distributed K-means++

2. distributed balanced K-means tree

K-means++ and balanced k-means tree have been tested. The result is accurate and the performance of my K-mean++ is superior to the implementation of k-means in spark mlib. They are all implemented by pyspark.


Please view https://github.com/DavidXubin/machine_learning/blob/master/balanced_kmeans_tree/bkt_publish.ipynb to check the explanation of algorithm design and implementation.

To do work:
1. distributed spectrum cluster
